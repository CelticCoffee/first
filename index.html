		<h2>Goals</h2>
			<p>In the fall, I enrolled in the Edx online course through Harvard called CS50 (introduction to computer science).  Having spent my professional life to date as a violinist, composer and small business owner, I did not expect to either like or enjoy the course but much to my amazement, I loved it.  My initial interests were in pivoting careers into the field of graphic design in order to retain a heavy artistic component to my professional life.  But after the experience of beginning to code in C, I realized that I have a great fascination with what is going on under the hood. </p>

			<p>I don't just want to make it look pretty, I want to make it do things.  As a small business owner, I have both benefited from and banged my head against walls for lack of savvy technology to meet my needs.  Countless times I have wished that I had the skills to create something the way I wanted it to be on the web. These days it is critically important in business, the arts and most every other genre to be able to represent oneself impressively online. 
			</p>

			<p>I am here in this class because I am determined to become a developer and while there are lots of good online resources, I want to begin to connect with people in the industry, to see what the collaborative side of life in the developer world is like and to have the accountability of a formal program to help me move towards my goal.  I have no illusion that I'll leave this first class with all of the tools necessary but I am hoping to be on that journey by beginning a portfolio of work that will open doors for future educational opportunities be they internships, further schooling or strong professional connections. </p>

	        <h2>Concerns About Learning html</h2>
			<p>I've never written in html, css or javascript so I have nowhere to go but up!  It's a steep learning curve but I am very interested in the subject so I plan to enjoy the journey.  The biggest challenge will likely be just carving out the time to thoroughly and properly internalize everything.  I tend to be a real hands on type of learner which can be time consuming. </p>
